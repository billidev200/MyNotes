# IAST

**How Does IAST Work**\
IAST testing occurs in real-time, just like DAST, while the application runs in the staging environment. IAST can identify the line of code causing security issues and quickly inform the developer for immediate remediation. IAST checks the source code similar to SAST, but at the post-build stage, unlike SAST, which occurs during development. IAST agents are typically deployed on the application servers. When the DAST scanner performs its work by reporting a vulnerability, the deployed IAST agent will now return a line number of the issue from the source code. Can deploy IAST agents on an application server. During functional testing performed by a QA tester, the agent studies every pattern that a data transfer inside the application follows regardless of whether it's dangerous. For example, if data is coming from a user and the user wants to perform an SQL Injection on the application by appending an SQL query to a request, the request will be flagged as dangerous.
