# SSDLC

## Why is Secure SDLC important?

Apart from faster development and reduction of costs, integrating security across the SDLC helps discover and reduce vulnerabilities early, reducing business risk massively. Examples of introducing security at all stages are architecture analysis during design, code review and scanners during the development stage and conducting security assessments (e.g. penetration tests) before deployment. For example, in waterfall models, this sort of testing was carried out at the end of the lifecycle, right before production; in more agile processes, we can implement a "security by design" approach. If the pentests result in errors like an SQL injection in a waterfall scenario, mitigating the bugs would entail doing another cycle to fix the bug. It would require redesigning, applying the changes and retesting to check it has been remediated. In a more agile approach, discussions on whether to prevent flaws like this, such as deciding on parameterisation during the planning phase, can avoid having to roll back changes, and it only costs a planning discussion.
