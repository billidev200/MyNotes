# Vulnerability Management

**Vulnerability Management**\
Vulnerability management is an ongoing, proactive, and frequently automated activity that protects computer systems, networks, and enterprise solutions from cyberattacks and data breaches. Consequently, it is a vital component of an overall security program. By discovering, evaluating, and correcting potential security flaws, businesses can help avoid attacks and mitigate their effects if they occur.

**Vulnerability Scanning**\
Since vulnerability management is the process surrounding vulnerability scanning, it is essential to know how vulnerability scans are conducted and the tools at hand. Today, operating a vulnerability scanning tool requires little technical knowledge. Most vulnerability scanners may be operated via a graphical user interface, allowing a user to do vulnerability scans on a whole network with a few mouse clicks.\
Security vendors offer various technological solutions with varying deployment choices, including standalone, managed services, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Some popular commercial vulnerability scanning tools include Nessus, Nexpose, and Acunetix. On the other hand, some good open-source solutions like Greenbone (community edition), OWASP ZAP and many more.
