# Printer Hacking

## The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) 631

When an IPP port is open to the internet, it is possible for anyone to print to the printer or even transfer malicious data through it (using it as a middleman for attacks).

An open IPP port can expose a lot of sensitive information such as printer name, location, model, firmware version, or even printer wifi SSID.
