# Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfigurations include:

* Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets.
* Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.
* Default accounts with unchanged passwords.
* Error messages that are overly detailed and allow attackers to find out more about the system.
* Not using [HTTP security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/).
