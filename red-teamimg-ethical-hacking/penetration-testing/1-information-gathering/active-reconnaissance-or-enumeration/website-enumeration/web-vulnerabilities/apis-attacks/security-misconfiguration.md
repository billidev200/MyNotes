# Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration depicts an implementation of incorrect and poorly configured security controls that put the security of the whole API at stake. Several factors can result in security misconfiguration, including improper/incomplete default configuration, publically accessible cloud storage, [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), and error messages displayed with sensitive data. Intruders can take advantage of these misconfigurations to perform detailed reconnaissance and get unauthorised access to the system.&#x20;
