## &#x20;truncate

```bash
truncate -s <size> <filename>
```

* `-s` sets the size.
* `0` means reduce the file size to **zero bytes**.

***

### üß† Why Use `truncate`?

* Safer than `rm` for system logs (some apps require the log file to exist)
* Avoids creating "missing file" errors in monitored directories
* Less suspicious in post-exploitation compared to deleting log files

***

## Shred ( HDD Only )

```bash
shred [options] <file>
```

#### üîç Option Breakdown:

* `-u`: Remove the file after overwriting it
* `-z`: Add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
* `-n 3`: Number of overwrite passes (default is 3)

## &#x20;**Remove Logs** (Common Locations)

```
sudo rm -f /var/log/wtmp /var/log/btmp /var/log/lastlog /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog
```

* `wtmp` ‚Äì Records logins
* `btmp` ‚Äì Records failed login attempts
* `lastlog` ‚Äì Stores the last login of each user
* `auth.log` ‚Äì Authentication logs
* `syslog` ‚Äì General system messages

> On RedHat-based systems, the logs might be in `/var/log/secure` and `/var/log/messages`.
