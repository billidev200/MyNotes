# Payloads/shells

**ChatGPT said:**

In cybersecurity and ethical hacking, **payloads** refer to pieces of code or data delivered to a target system as part of an exploit. They perform specific actions once the exploit is successful. Payloads can be **malicious** or **benign** depending on context (e.g., red teaming vs. actual cyber attacks).

#### ðŸ”¹ Common Types of Payloads

**1. Shell Payloads**

* **Bind Shell**: Opens a port on the victimâ€™s machine and binds a shell to it.
* **Reverse Shell**: Victim connects back to the attacker, giving remote shell access.
* **Meterpreter Shell**: Advanced shell provided by Metasploit, offering in-memory execution and post-exploitation tools.

**2. Staged vs. Stageless Payloads**

* **Staged**: Sends a small initial payload (stage 1), which downloads and executes a larger payload.
  * Example: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* **Stageless**: Entire payload is delivered at once.
  * Example: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

**3. Download & Execute**

* Downloads an executable from a remote server and runs it.
* Often used for dropping malware or tools.

**4. Command Execution**

* Executes specific OS commands (like `whoami`, `net user`, etc.).
* Can be used to gather information or escalate privileges.

**5. In-Memory Payloads**

* Never write to disk; reside and run in memory.
* Harder to detect by antivirus.
* Example: PowerShell scripts, `Invoke-Mimikatz`, etc.

**6. Fileless Payloads**

* Use existing OS utilities (e.g., PowerShell, WMI) without writing files to disk.
* Often used in fileless malware attacks.

**7. Keylogger Payloads**

* Captures keystrokes on the target system.
* Often used for credential harvesting.

**8. Persistence Payloads**

* Establish backdoors to ensure continued access (e.g., registry modification, scheduled tasks).

**9. Privilege Escalation Payloads**

* Exploit misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.

**10. Ransomware Payloads**

* Encrypts the victimâ€™s data and demands payment for decryption.

**11. Data Exfiltration Payloads**

* Steals specific data (credentials, documents, tokens) and sends it to the attacker.

**12. Denial of Service (DoS) Payloads**

* Disrupt services or crash systems by consuming resources or triggering crashes.
