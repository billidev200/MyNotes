# Metasploit Payloads

### What Are Metasploit Payloads?

A **payload** in Metasploit is the code executed on the target machine once an exploit succeeds. Payloads are modular and can be customized to perform different tasks like opening a remote shell, running commands, or installing backdoors.

### Types of Metasploit Payloads

#### 1. **Singles**

* Self-contained payloads.
* Do everything in one go — exploit, payload, and connect back.
* Example: `windows/shell_bind_tcp` (opens a shell bound to a TCP port).
* Usually small and simple.
* Good for quick tests but less flexible.

#### 2. **Stagers**

* Small initial payloads designed to set up a communication channel between the attacker and victim.
* Download and execute the larger payload (the **stage**).
* Example: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` stager connects back to the attacker.

#### 3. **Stages**

* Larger payloads downloaded by the stager.
* Provide advanced features (e.g., Meterpreter’s post-exploitation capabilities).
* Examples: `meterpreter`, `vnc_inject`, etc.

## &#x20;What are **msfvenom iterations**?

In **msfvenom**, **iterations** (`-i` option) refers to how many times a payload encoder is applied **repeatedly** to the payload to make it harder to detect by antivirus or intrusion detection systems.

#### How Iterations Work:

* When you encode a payload, it transforms the payload’s bytecode to obfuscate it.
* **Running multiple iterations** means the encoder is applied again and again, each time further obfuscating the payload.
* This can help evade signature-based detection because the final encoded payload looks different every time.
