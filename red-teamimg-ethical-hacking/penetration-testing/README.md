# Penetration Testing

Penetration testing (often called **pen testing** or **ethical hacking**) is a security practice where cybersecurity professionals simulate attacks on a computer system, network, or web application to find and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them.

#### What is Penetration Testing?

* **Purpose:** To identify security weaknesses and risks in an organizationâ€™s digital assets.
* **How it works:** A pen tester tries to exploit vulnerabilities using the same tools and techniques as a real attacker, but in a controlled, authorized manner.
* **Goal:** To help improve security by providing a report of findings and recommendations for fixing issues.

#### Types of Penetration Testing

1. **Black Box Testing**\
   The tester has no prior knowledge of the system. It simulates an external hacker attack.
2. **White Box Testing**\
   The tester has full knowledge of the system, including source code and architecture. This is like an insider attack simulation.
3. **Gray Box Testing**\
   Partial knowledge is given to the tester, representing a more realistic scenario of an attacker who has some insider info.

#### Common Targets in Penetration Testing

* **Networks** (internal and external)
* **Web applications**
* **Mobile apps**
* **Wireless networks**
* **APIs**
* **Physical security controls (sometimes)**

#### Penetration Testing Process (High Level)

1. **Planning and Reconnaissance:** Gathering info about the target.
2. **Scanning:** Using tools to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
3. **Gaining Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to get into the system.
4. **Maintaining Access:** Checking if the attacker can maintain control.
5. **Analysis and Reporting:** Documenting findings and advising on fixes.
